puts on sneakers,
head bobbing with sneakers looking smug,
twerking lay eggs to cook in pans sizzling,
does the worm with the arms, customers to the worm with their bodies
black customers suddenly do footwork to the beat of the music,
stepping roaches doing the jiggy foot dance


  <p>At Ma’s chicken shack you know you are right at home.
  Your parents are dead? No one loves you? Ma is there (portrait with open wings)
Ma takes a sexual advertisement class and learns the power of advertising her company through sex appeal, with jazz music Ma makes her Chicken shack a strip club and gives her customers lap dances with music playing in the background

Ma understands. Family fun! A family is at Ma’s chicken shack enjoying themselves and laughing all of a sudden there is a high heel of Ma in the frame and they stare mid chicken in their mouth, cut to scene and frames of people around the restaurant staring mid bite.

Ma says: “I see y’all enjoying yalls chicken, but did you know?....”
Ma says: My snatch is as wet and juicy as my chicken!

They (especially parents) stare in shock. A little boy take a photo with a huge hd camera.

Whip sounds from behind ma, 2 muscular KKK members with the hat but with white tank tops and oiled muscular bodies whip Ma’s ass and say “Ya! Get down on your kneeeeeees bitch”

Ma bites her lip in lust while “Let’s hold hands jazz music” plays in the background Ma:“Why, yes master!”

Nasty minded now, 2 people in the restaurant look at each other with approving grins. Ma is bombarded by customers giving her money

Ma dances and shakes her ass to the beat of Flowers and Roses by Vandell Andrew
For that one part shakes her ass to the beat
For that second part sashay walks in fishnets and boots


Random scene: you remember that misogynistic rap song after that freak bark says “Down with your pandering asses “ then points down and the blue haired mf go down to hell

Scene: Freak Bark is laying down boucing a basketball with his tongue then, eventually he grabs
the basketball with his hand then raises himself and speaks in basketball bounces and you see captions
of him plotting how he will ...

Disco Head and TeeVee boo'ed up with Disco head with a glock pointing, and RayDeeDo dancing Disco Head shoots the gun to 
the back of Ma's head and she lays a fuck ton of eggs as her eyes roll back to her head, zoom out and this World
is just ingredieants in a skillet that Ma is cooking for her customers as she flips the contents of the inside
of the pan , she winks at the camera (Song: Best of my love)

After seeing the black man Freak-Bark yells in the sky and then turns into A-Freak-Kahnz
He has bones on his neck and starts dancing Afrikaans
Scene: Church priest says “who will happily get on their knees for the speaker of god?
People smile to each other but then Ma says “I will, I will” 
And runs down the middle isle on her knees and opens her mouth with her tongue out
The priest smiles and pulls down his pants and puts his dick inside ma’s mouth and starts mouth fucking Ma making gagging sounds as her eyes roll back , the priest head goes back in pleasure
Then Fruit-Bar slams open the doors of the church staring blankly .kisshsy says: “No no, it’s okay, keep mouthfucking MY pet chicken!” He continues to stare ahead. The church people stare and so does the priest and there is silence and Ma lays and egg that falls and cracks and shows a priest chicken baby fumbling and disgusting
A fly flies past Fruit-Bar’s face and it stops and gets scared and flies on wall and says 
“Boy, would I like to be a fly on the wall for this one!” Pointing at Fruit-Bar
Fruit-Bar looks at ma’s mouth then bleakly looks at the fumbling baby then pulls out a flock and shoots the baby, every one screams
Fruit-Bar holding Glock with both hands while walking towards priest shoots him repeatedly and grabs Ma holding her above his shoulder and walks away out of the church with a bleak face as people are screaming and running

Freak-Bark enjoys sneaking up behind Fruit-Bar like he is stalking her like prey and her
doe-eyed is scared and wary, until he finally show up from behind with his wrigling fingers
and licks her icy body

Scene: freak bark tries to be human in front of other black people and is looking left and right and says

Another freak-bark episode: Freak-Bark sees a nigger man and he is just minding his business walking around, until he pulls out 2 WHOLE ROTISERRE CHICKENS FROM PANT POCKETS AND PROCEEDS TO EAT THE CHICKEN LIKE A DAMN ANIMAL. Freak-Bark starts to convulse and tries to hold back from screaming the N word into the sky. Then the nigger boy takes off his pants and puts on basketball shorts out of the blue, then an ice cream trolley strolls by and the black guy gives the man some money as if he is paying for ice cream but instead the man hands him a basketball and the nigger smiles and the ice cream man waves goodbye happily then continues pushing his trolley. The man the jumps and shoots the basketball and it misses , (cuts to a black and white rewind, and a commenter pops up on the bottom right of the screen and nods and says: “Now we all know, that’s not what happened”) then the rewind continues with the basketball actually going through the hoop. At this point Freak-Bark actually explodes and yells into the sky yelling nigger but instead it is censored out and the camera zooms out from ground level towards the sky as he screams it

  <p>    Fruit-Bar calls a cat from another cartoon to enter this realm to teach Freak-Bark about kindness and how to be good and to try to heal Freak-Barks severe internal darkness to make sure he doesn’t self euthanize…..
At the end daffodil coldly realizes something as Daffodil visualizes and calms his mind to see within Freak-Bark scene shows Freak-Bark asleep with his mouth open as daffodil talks to the entities within his mouth and they explain later in the episode like to the end of it:

that without the euthanization Freak-Bark beings on the planet will exponentially adapt to become more emotionless….cold….destructive
The paranormal entities within  explain this…
They say to daffodil that the alliance that Freak-Bark has made with beings of the paranormal is an  adaption that only happens as a result of living with such a disgusting and nourishing environment

They show a vision of a an immune system going autom immune, to turn against your own kind in favor of us outsiders…. A society that hasn’t looked at themselves and their actions in the mirror in a very long time… the immune cells are attacking their own kind like it is the sickness or they enemy …. And they act like it sometimes

If you manage to remove us somehow… then Freak-Bark will have no family…. opening trust to be hurt once again by his own kind…. And then at that point…. We will have his trust more than ever…. He will come running back to us….. and we will take him in like always with open arms…. And fill in all the gaps and emotional needs he has….. The gaps your kind has always failed to fill. None of you failures can do your job….. But we can….. You keep losing your kind to the arms of paranormal strangers…. If you take his euthanization away it will drive him more insane and angry with wrath and he’ll lead more of your kind to us

  says Hi there I’m daffodil the cat! 
Freak-Bark “What are you? From another cartoon? How can you exist here this alters the laws of physics , I already don’t understand psyics but if you came here from another cartoon surely you are going against physics , and therefore you must be doing the work of the devil!
Daffodil : stares, I’m not doing devil’s work, you just met me, you cannot label me so quickly before getting to know me. 
Freak bark TES I CAN! I CAN LABEL YOU HOWEVER AND WHENEVER ID LIKE ! 
Furiously pulls out a sticky note and and writes the word label on it and angrily sticks it on daffodils forehead. Daffodil eyes look up at the label and she just stares at freak-bark unimpressed with this level of dumbness
Freak bark is roaring hands coming out of his mouth snarling and drooling barking
Daffodil throws a pan at his head and it bongs and he falls to the floor with drool coming out

Scene: Daffodil the Cat brightens up Freak-Bark days and says would you like to see this show on TV
Freak-Bark“No TV is boring”
Daffodil points in the air“ Ah, but I have a tape of educational cartoons from around the world…”
Freak-Bark whips around  and points at his chin“ Around the world?”
Puts in the tape and Freak-Bark zooms in front of the stomach with his legs swaying back and forth in the air and his hands are on his chin and he is interested


Daffodil and Freak-Bark are playing with balloons bouncing them and Freak-Bark just busts them
with his hands, Daffodil says "Hey, Freaky, can you stop popping the ballons? It makes a really loud
noise and it scares me" Freak-Bark continues doing this and this starts pissing off . Daffodil then gets angry
then aggressively pounces on Freak-Bark and starts brushing his fur with a body brush and his face as
Freak-Bark desperately tries to fight back, Daffodil bounces off then whistles, and many ballons ambush him
because of his fur's static electricity, Daffodil then notices that is is raining soon to thunder and she puts on
noise-blocking headphones and opens then window and lets a thunder sound throughout the apartment and And
eye peeps out of the many baloons in fear of the loud thunder sound.

  <p>The GCC lands on a planet. The Party Race are meant to entertain at birthday parties and special events. The Party Race get a download to their systems from their creators to become more party-like. The Party Race initially decided that beings at parties crave dopamine and they encouraged others to eat healthy and drink water but then they were ridiculed. The Party Race are confused and as a collective decide a part B for the beings to get their dopamine. They decide as a group that nothing gets a party going full of dopamine than heroin and sex.

  <p>The GCC gets notified. The ExtractType race is here. Every 10,000 years these beings are born from their mothership’s uterus and they go down to a severely stagnating planet that is slow in evolving intelligently. The ExtractTypes land on these planets and start abducting beings and taking them back to their motherships to see “what went wrong” while executing the rest, leaving room for new life. The GCC refuse to harm others for the ExtractTypes, but with the little time they have left they attempt to evolve and educate the primitive inhabitants as much as they can to prevent a mass execution, free of charge.</p>

  <p>The BeeBoops are here. After asking Cognition about his homo sapien commander they are taught by Cognition on how emotions can be manipulated making humans feel guilty for thinking outside the norm without being prompted to do so and that this can assist the BeeBoops in controlling beings. They will ridicule each other and doubt the real truth in exchange for group acceptance. In contrast to others, Cognition's approach begins at the root, understanding the lifeforms he’s interacting with, and by targeting the mind. This control happens with no words said to the controlled. The world is filled with lies and ignorance, and the homo sapiens claiming to be the only intelligent life so far, are none the wiser.
Robot : “We are employed by Freak-Bark, so we still have work here” submission and bdsm. The humans claim to want more power but their actions demonstrate they still want to experience submission in more forms than one

I had to suck it up for the culture and identity  you imposed on me now you are petrified only because I am doing it back , except this time I am winning, and you know deep down your culture will never recover from this devastating blow. you imposed a culture and identity down my throat that does not belong to me with listening to my true origins but now I finally have found my true home and I will ensure you never have a place to go back to. 

I can finally rest in peace and now your the one who is homesick

    Myuzik talks like I ❤️ Radio
    Las Vegas Peacock respects autonomy of movement, Freak-Bark puppy, Las Vegas Peacock holding Freak-Bark like a kin “Ever since you claimed me, I knew I promised I would be damned if anything inferior attempted to get in the way of our relationship” Las Vegas Peacock versus the Location-Confined Cages. Houses with large hand coming out of head of house, House: “Oh your going out of the country for travel? Don’t go too far because the distance between will be multiplied by 2 because you’ll have to cover that same amount of distance on your way back to me, YOUR HOME.” “Freak-Bark: Your not my home, you’re just a house to me, if you won’t come with me while I travel and force me to use my resources to come back you are inferior, I know I can do better” House: “Really? We are all you have, houses, apartments, gyms, all these buildings, you must come to us, just adapt to it, NOT ONLY THE SAME PLANET, but the SAME COUNTRY, SAME STATE, SAME CITY, SAME STREET IN THAT CITY. DON”T YOU LIKE LIVING ON THE SAME STREET EVERYDAY?” Freak-Bark is visibly fuming. HOUSE: “Go ahead and go on your trip to Turkey, you’ll end up coming back home to this same street, not like the diversity from the outside will have enough time to influence you like I have. You will accept the heritage that I say belongs to you or I will force it down your throat” “You have to understand that the music, food, and culture we have here is what makes US unique” Freak-Bark tells Las Vegas Peacock: “Destroy them all, we can’t afford for these beings to recover” Las-Vegas Peacock nods and calls in Home Wrecker (worldquake eruption) Devastated family says to Las Vegas peacock “You’re evil” Las Vegas Peacock “Sweetheart, I promise I will show you true evil by the end of tonight” Freak-Bark is off with his international horse and the human that repressed Freak-Bark is on his knees and he looks back at the bitch begging for mercy as so much has been destroyed of her culture (background voice: I was on my way to leave that nasty fucking place until I took a whiff and smelled something so god damn repulsive I was about go insane, but then I realized who it was and then called my lover (Las Vegas Peacock)) Las Vegas in the lord position looks at the man from afar and grabs a spiked wrecking ball on many chains and spins it maddingly before one foot launching it towards the man, the man hands held in front, he is crushed and dies but just before the ball hits international horse spins around runs towards the man and Freak-Bark cuts off his head and then the wrecking ball hits the man and he dies. Cut to seeing the man’s head on the wall as a trophy of Freak-Barks craft. War Lion’s aircrafts spray chemicals and causes the weather to change, adding blizzards and tornadoes. Freak-Bark inner dialogue “I know how much you love your culture, so much they you imposed it onto me even after I told you I was getting home sick. But you see those airlines spraying those gases? That’s the blood of your people, and from the looks of it, it looks like we are winning!”
“Now it is my time to impose my culture pride onto your kind! I’m sorry, what’s that? I CAN”T FUCKING HEAR YOU, I CAN”T FUCKING HEAR ANYONE, I”M GOING CRAZY, I”M SO FUCKING PISSED OFF AND THE UNHOLY HAS ME CRAVING YOUR CULTURE TO DIE”.... “You don’t understand…. You are dying out…… and maybe….. You will never have the time to understand because there is not enough time left anymore…..”
What was holding Freak-Bark back was money.. “The only reason I had to suck up to you (vision of multiple houses very quickly) is BECAUSE OF MONEY. I had to deal with all the shit you put me through and all those incompatible beings within that household because I needed to survive. The money always comforts me…. Now guess what….?” Looks into sky , Las Vegas Peacock slowly points to slots, thunder of las Vegas, 3 slots of money hit the giant sky slot machine, and a enormous thunder sounds and money rains from the sky as the slot machine sounds blares hauntingly. Las Vegas Peacock in calm sexy voice:  “Quick. Stray from the chains of this inferior culture, and come to home with Daddy, to Las Vegas” shows las vegas with his muscular hand as he points to heaven. Much transportation desperately escaping his direction going off into the distance.


After freak-bark tells las vegas peacock after the house emits its last words Las Vegas calls on phone and dials and says: “Hey! Wonderful night we’re having, right?” tapping fingers on desk , so sexy. “Get everything set up, I need to you to bring in a parade” Lion Dog in the running parade as they pass through village that calls themselves a city… it is bouncing around slapping the symbol and shaking instruments and making funny faces jumping around and kids and people are amused and laughing.
A man grabs onto the leg of Freak-Bark and cries “Please, leave us alone!” Freak-Bark furiously looks at this pest and says “I SAID. MAKE YOURSELF AT (kicks him in the face) HOME” 
Las Vegas Peacock: “You guys… This doesn’t have to be seen as death, come with me if it feels like home and you’ll see that it is heaven… Mental Reframing, people” points and taps head with his eyes closed. &$#@^ Laughs calmly and demonically. His neon cyan eye pops open and dims dark blue as he sees a peahen just his size moving like a pigeon , bird-eyed picking cities off into the sky like a bird cleans a place of twigs and then she sees Las Vegas Peacock. Peacock strongly walks up to her but a city is in the way and he rips it out from the ground and launches it while saying: “MOVE” in a deep and unnatural demonic voice. He clears his throat and begins to dance. Peacock has her attention and she says in her internal dialogue in another language “Finally, all those years of dance recital has finally paid off” As people die there’s flashbacks of peahen’s dance recitals and of people currently dying in the background combined as one. When peacock is done he gets on his knees and shows his chest showing a glowing symbol of Sitri. Peahen coos staring at the glowing symbol. A person bumps into the a lion dog and gets in the way and it looks down with a slightly open mouth surprised, then it slowly raises a walky talky and speaks into it. Someone slightly behind in the parade hears though the walki talki and puts a nuke inside of a tank and the black tank is seen by the person who got in the way and he grabs his girlfriend as he see it is pointing in his direction he panics and points at it then runs, then the tank shoots the nuke and obliterates the area of land.
“Go ahead and try to shove culture down my children’s throat again, if I lend them to your land it is because I expect you to take care of them. But don’t be fooled, they have the same high standards as me, they just love exploring the land.”






Church Preacher“Do not worry, for our Lord is with us and we are his children, and so Lord shall not forsake us”
Black hands are reaching from the roof of the broken and quite dismantled church so much so that the people of the church can look up and see the TR3B craft slowly levitating above DISTORTED TR3B VOICE “Raise your hands, and beg for your new god’s mercy.”

Woman points at the sky at TR3B and yells “THERE IS NO GOD!!!!” in fear and everything gasps and screams and runs. TR3B does a devastating attack on the church, many black out and die
Woman: “HELP! MY BABY”S BURNING”, baby screaming in agony. 


Las Vegas Peacock speaks: Picks up the phone from the sky slow-motion and sexy. “Mhmm, yes. I see.” Hangs up. Calm tone speaking to city being destroyed says“There seems to be a misunderstanding, we do not represent the people of Vegas, we represent the unseen forces there, especially you, my father, SITRI” Disco led balls rain from the sky and some slam into the city slow motion some sink into the ground like a liquid after he said this. LAS VEGAS PEACOCK “If you say it’s pseudo science and the unseen do not exist, then aren’t you the laughing stock of today, because all of you are going to die anyways.” takes out cigarette and smokes it “Anyways, in one ear and out the other, carry on….”
Obese black bitch twirling on one toe in ballerina costume war music, flashes back and forth between her and a rotisserie chicken in a ballerina suit spinning like a motherfucker
Demonic Voice: “See that black bitch in the ballerina suit? Twirling like a motherfucker….”
^^^^^ first track as the bitch spins and Raddio dancing Meez dance https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOUwvjnE-f8
Gorrilla bitch deep throating a banana to the beat

Freak-Bark yells at city and it is dying and screaming: “STOP TREATING ME LIKE A DOG! THERE’S NO DOG IN MY SOUL, YOU FUCKERS ARE MAKING ME FUCKING HOMESICK!!!!!!!!!”
